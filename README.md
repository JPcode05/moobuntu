# Moobuntu
A version of Ubuntu in spirit of the cows. Its goals are to:
* Remove all snap support, getting packages compiled from Pop-OS instead
* Allow people to choose any desktop they want, with the default being GNOME, but allowing users to choose KDE, Xfce, MATE or Cinnamon instead
* Be as close to pre-snap Ubuntu as possible
* More to come...

I, James ([JPcode05](https://github.com/JPcode05)), need your help on this project. Go to the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/JPcode05/moobuntu) and [file an issue](https://github.com/JPcode05/moobuntu/issues) to contact me about what to do with this project.

This page is work in progress and will update dynamically over time.
