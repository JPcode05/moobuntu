# Moobuntu
A version of Ubuntu in spirit of the cows. Its goals are to:
* Remove all snap support, getting packages compiled from Pop-OS instead
* Allow people to choose any desktop they want, with the default being GNOME, but allowing users to choose KDE, Xfce, MATE or Cinnamon instead
* Be as close to pre-snap Ubuntu as possible
* More to come...
